# MeetUp__3.0
The app designed at the #AndelaALC17 MeetUp in #ALCGombe, the app mimicks the Android Dialer activity.
As promised sorry its coming late.
## Description
The code idea is simple, I added `onClick` functionality to 2 buttons (`button1` and the `backspaceButton`)
you can check the `activity_main.xml` and the `MainActivity.java` file for the implementation of the functions.
When `button1` is clicked "1" appears on the EditText and when the backspace button is pressed, it clears the "1"
on the `EditText` is cleared.
## Tasks
Modify the code to respond to all numeric buttons and if you can make the funtion keys display text on the screen
i.e. `CallButton` should display "Call" on the `EditText`, `messageButton` "Message" and so on.
## Where to modify
`activity_main.xml` and `MainActivity.java`
