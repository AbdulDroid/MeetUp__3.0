# MeetUp__3.0
The app designed at the #AndelaALC17 MeetUp in #ALCGombe, the app mimicks the Android Dialer activity.
As promised sorry its coming late.
## Description
The code idea is simple, I added onClick functionality to 2 buttons (button 1 and the backspace button)
you can check the activity_main.xml and the MainActivity.java file for the implementation of the functions.
When button 1 is clicked "1" appears on the EditText and when the backspace button is pressed, it clears the "1"
on the EditText is cleared.
## Tasks
Modify the code to respond to all numeric buttons and if you can make the funtion keys display text on the screen
i.e. Call button should display "Call" on the EditText, message button "Message" and so on.
## Where to modify
activity_main.xml and MainActivity.xml
